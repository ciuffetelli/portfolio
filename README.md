### Global dependencies

You just need to have these dependencies installed:

- Node.js LTS v18npm  (or any higher version)

Do you use nvm? Then you can run nvm install in the project folder to install and use the most appropriate version of Node.js.
Do you use asdf? Then you don’t need to worry about Node.js versioning.

### Local dependencies

After downloading the project, don’t forget to install the project’s local dependencies.

```bash
npm run dev
``` 
- This will run the services needed to run the application. You can access the home page through the URL shown or the default URL, see below.
- To stop all these services, simply use the ‘CTRL – C’ hotkeys, which is the terminal standard for the killing process.

```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```
